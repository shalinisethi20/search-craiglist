Built With
I have created application using Java 8 and SpringBoot. 
I have chosen SpringBoot because it is much easier to configure and plays well with other tech stacks. I have also used a REST API and ROME to read RSS feed.
I used Spring Initializer to add all the dependencies and create a blank working project with all my configurations.
I have used Maven as the build tool
